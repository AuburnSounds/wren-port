# wren-port

[Wren](https://wren.io/) is a small, fast, class-based concurrent scripting language.
`wren-port` is a port of the Wren programming language implementation to D, intended for embedding. This is useful is you want a `nothrow @nogc` fast interpreter in your D application.

The original Wren implementation is [here](https://github.com/wren-lang).
