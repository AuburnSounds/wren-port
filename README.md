# wren-d

[Wren](https://wren.io/) is a small, fast, class-based concurrent scripting language.
This is a port of the Wren programming language implementation to D, for easy embedding in D applications. This is useful is you want a `nothrow @nogc` faster interpreter.

The original Wren code is [here](https://github.com/wren-lang).
